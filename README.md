bin like that my whole life, plus, im a fucking tweaker of 30yrs, all i know is persistance no matter what the level of difficulty may be...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not just this ai shit, but other shit too, im pretty decent with computers, i bin slapping computers and cellphones together
my whole adult life of 30yrs, im 47yrs old as of today sun sept 08 2024, but this is my first REAL dip in the waters behind the software scene,
up until this point i bin all about MS_windows, i remember as a kid in 4th grade learning DOS on like an apple ii, but it didnt have my full attention yet...
- 📫 How to reach me is im pretty sure imma keep this part of me concealed, like a felon with a fire arm but for fucks sake imma leave you with my email address

so having said all that, hello, its nice to meet you and im sorry if i fuck some of your coding up, please be easy on me, im new to this
but you have my email if you need to tell me about it...
